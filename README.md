Expands upon Olezen's Unity Source Movement to include functionality for rocket jumping and other blast related physics calculations. Some things can probably be done more efficient or better, however I couldn't find any open-source examples of this, so instead I just decided to make what I created in my free time avaliable to the public. This code simpily adds a way to calculate explosion force and automatically add it to the character's movement script. Currently, water doesn't work as I had to turn it off, the collider was messing up and I decided to leave it till later. It should be fixed whenever I get the time to.
